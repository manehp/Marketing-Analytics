 Introduction

 Innovation diffusion analysis helps us understand how new products are adopted over time. 
This report focuses on the Laifen Wave Toothbrush (2024), a groundbreaking electric 
toothbrush that combines oscillation and vibration technologies, alongside app-based 
customization and eco-friendly design. Using historical data from a comparable innovation, 
the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean (2010), we estimate adoption trends using the Bass 
Diffusion Model.
 The goal is to forecast the diffusion path of the Laifen Wave globally and estimate the number 
of adopters per year.

 1. Product Overview – Laifen Wave Toothbrush

 The Laifen Wave Toothbrush is a premium oral care device featuring:
 Dual-motion cleaning: oscillation up to 60° and vibration up to 66,000 strokes per 
minute
 App-based customization: control over speed, oscillation, and vibration
 Hygienic nano-molded design: prevents bacterial buildup
 Dynamic brush balancing: metal counterweight reduces vibration and protects gums
 Eco-friendly packaging: biodegradable materials and no power adapter included
 Magnetic charging and waterproofing: IPX7-certified, low power consumption modes
 Price: $79.99
 Current Users: ~8 million
 Warranty: 1 year, 30-day money-back guarantee
 The product represents a major step forward in smart oral care, combining technological 
precision, personalized user experience, and sustainability.

 2. Similar Innovation – Philips Sonicare DiamondClean (2010)

 The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean introduced sonic vibration technology (up to 31,000 
strokes per minute) to the mass market. At the time, it represented a shift from traditional 
oscillating brushes toward high-frequency vibration and digital feedback.
 Comparison:
Feature DiamondClean (2010) Laifen Wave (2024)
 Cleaning mechanism Vibration only Vibration + Oscillation
 User control Basic modes App-based, real-time 
customization
 Design Standard Nano-molded, hygienic, 
eco-friendly
 Market impact Premium oral care Global, tech-forward, 
health-conscious
 The Laifen Wave extends the innovation trajectory of DiamondClean by integrating dual 
motion, smart controls, and sustainable design features.

 3. Historical Data

 Historical global electric toothbrush adoption data (2010–2030) was used as a proxy for 
Laifen Wave adoption:

 4. Bass Diffusion Model
 The Bass Diffusion Model predicts new product adoption using three parameters:
 p (coefficient of innovation): likelihood of adoption by innovators
 q (coefficient of imitation): influence of previous adopters on new adoption
 M (market potential): total possible number of adopters
 Using nonlinear regression (curve_fit) on cumulative adoption data:
p = 0.0113 → a small fraction of innovators adopt early
 q = 0.0894 → imitation plays a moderate role in spreading adoption
 M = 3,000 million units → global market potential
 This suggests:
 1. Early stage: Adoption will start slowly, as innovators try the Laifen Wave.
 2. Growth stage: Imitators gradually drive adoption; the S-curve will start to rise more 
noticeably.
 3. Saturation: The market could eventually approach 3 billion users, reflecting a global 
potential if the product reaches wide distribution.

5. Diffusion Forecast – Laifen Wave Toothbrush
Using the Bass model, we forecast global adoption of the Laifen Wave:
Annual new adopters: peak occurs around mid-lifecycle (~2030–2035)
Cumulative adopters: projected to approach market potential of ~1.3 billion globally

6. Scope
 Scope: Global electric toothbrush market
 Justification:
 Laifen Wave is sold internationally, competing with Philips, Oral-B, and other brands.
 Historical data used is global, providing realistic forecasts for worldwide adoption.
 Bass parameters estimated on global data capture both innovation and imitation 
dynamics.

7. Estimated Number of Adopters

Adoption follows the classic S-curve of Bass diffusion, with early adoption driven by 
innovators and peak adoption driven by imitators.

 Conclusion
 The Laifen Wave Toothbrush represents the next stage in smart oral care innovation, 
combining dual motion cleaning, app customization, and sustainable design.
 Using historical data from Philips Sonicare DiamondClean, we estimated Bass model 
parameters
 Forecasts suggest that global adoption will follow an S-shaped curve, peaking in the late 
2020s and approaching market saturation around 2030.
 Visualization of annual new adopters and cumulative adopters provides actionable 
insight into market growth and adoption dynamics.
